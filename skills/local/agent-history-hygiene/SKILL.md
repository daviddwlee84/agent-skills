description: Commit SpecStory transcripts and Claude/Cursor/OpenCode/Codex plans with feature diffs, derive staged `AI-Assisted-By` plus transcript/plan trailers, prevent secret leaks, and ignore SpecStory machine-local state. Use when asked to commit/save/stage agent sessions, record cross-harness provenance, bootstrap pre-commit, fix `.specstory/statistics.json` churn, scrub a transcript, or remediate accidental secret commits/pushes with rotate-first discipline.

# agent-history-hygiene

Keep agent transcripts and plan files in the commit that records their feature,
without leaking secrets or mutating a file while its recorder is active.

Surfaces, separated by purpose:

| Surface | Question it answers |
|---|---|
| `run-specstory-session.sh` | "How do I prove the recorder exited before finalization?" |
| `queue-agent-commit.sh` | "How do I queue this exact authorized commit without touching live history?" |
| `finalize-agent-commit.sh` | "How is the exact post-session snapshot sanitized and committed?" |
| `find-session.sh` | "Which transcript / plan file is my current session?" |
| `stage-agent-artifacts.sh` | "Which exact agent files belong in the prepared index?" |
| `agent-commit-metadata.sh` | "Which provenance trailers belong in the commit?" |
| `bootstrap-project.sh` | "How do I install validation-only hooks?" |
| `scan-staged.sh` | "Is the effective staged index clean?" |
| `probe-specstory-redaction.py` | "What does SpecStory redact natively?" |

## Core invariants

1. **Commit the transcript and plan with the feature they produced.** Never
   ignore `.specstory/history/` or silently drop dirty agent artifacts from the
   review trail.
2. **SpecStory state is not review history.** Ignore only
   `.specstory/.project.json` and `.specstory/statistics.json`; both are
   machine-local/regenerable.
3. **Quiescence comes before Git history movement.** An active recorder blocks
   commit, `pull --rebase`, rebase/update-base, integration, and worktree/session
   retirement. Required order:

   ```text
   recorder quiescence
     -> exact artifact + message finalization
     -> ordinary hook-enabled commit proven
     -> history/ref movement or retirement
   ```

4. **Provenance comes from the staged snapshot.** Use exact session, transcript,
   and plan selectors; never point a trailer at an unstaged artifact or guess an
   unknown model.
5. **Rotate at the provider before any Git rewrite.** Redaction prevents new
   reachability; it does not revoke a credential or erase every local copy.
6. **Never use plain `git push --force` as leak remediation.** It can destroy
   teammate work and does not remove bytes from existing clones/caches.
7. **Shipped files must be scanner-safe.** `npx skills add` installs this whole
   directory under a consumer's scan scope. Never embed a literal private-key
   header; build it at test runtime or use synthetic placeholders. Enforced by
   `tests/test_shipped_file_hygiene.py`.

## When to use

Use this skill when:

- the user asks to commit/save a SpecStory session, transcript, or plan;
- dirty `.specstory/history/*.md`, `.claude/plans/*.md`,
  `.cursor/plans/*.md`, or another configured artifact accompanies a feature;
- `.specstory/.project.json` or `statistics.json` keeps churning;
- the user asks to install pre-commit/gitleaks for agent artifacts;
- a scanner finds a secret in an agent artifact; or
- a credential was committed or pushed—read
  [`references/remediation.md`](references/remediation.md) before any rewrite.

Do not use it when the user explicitly wants agent history excluded, or when no
agent artifacts exist. If a leak is already on shared `main`/release, do not
suggest rewriting that branch; use the remediation runbook.

## Default lifecycle: queue now, finalize after exit

Read
[`references/post-session-finalization.md`](references/post-session-finalization.md)
before running or recovering this lifecycle. It defines every state, exit code,
recovery action, and no-retry boundary.

### 1. Launch the synchronous wrapper

From the intended worktree, before starting Claude:

```bash
bash skills/local/agent-history-hygiene/scripts/run-specstory-session.sh \
  --allow-commit claude
```

`--allow-commit` gives the **outer parent** a one-run finalizer capability. It
does not let the child infer user consent. The agent still waits for explicit
commit authorization before queueing.

Do not replace the wrapper with a Stop hook, detached watcher/daemon, or live
checkpoint. A Stop hook runs before process/recorder quiescence is proven; a
daemon separates recorder lifetime from the session; a live checkpoint commits
while the file can still change.

### 2. Work normally; stage only feature paths

Take the canonical lowercase UUID from Claude `/status`. Resolve the exact
SpecStory path and plan policy; if one UUID has multiple rendered aliases, pass
both UUID and path to disambiguate.

```bash
SESSION_ID=01234567-89ab-4cde-8fab-0123456789ab
TRANSCRIPT='.specstory/history/2026-09-01_02-14-50Z.md'
PLAN='.claude/plans/exact-change.md'

git add -- path/to/feature-a path/to/feature-b
```

Do **not** stage the live transcript or plan. The finalizer owns exact artifact
staging and sanitation after SpecStory exits.

### 3. After explicit user commit authorization, queue once

Create a UTF-8 base subject/body without lifecycle-managed trailers, then queue
with exact selectors:

```bash
MESSAGE_FILE="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agent-commit-message.txt"
printf '%s\n' \
  'feat(scope): summarize the change' \
  '' \
  'Explain why the change is needed.' > "$MESSAGE_FILE"

bash skills/local/agent-history-hygiene/scripts/queue-agent-commit.sh \
  --commit \
  --session-id "$SESSION_ID" \
  --specstory-path "$TRANSCRIPT" \
  --plan "$PLAN" \
  --message-file "$MESSAGE_FILE"
# Use --no-plan instead of --plan only when no plan exists.
```

The queue copies only the base message into private per-worktree state. It does
not read, stage, scan, redact, or commit the live transcript.

On `status=queued`, report **"finalization queued"** and exit the agent session.
Perform no further repository/index operation—not even `git status`, a diff, a
message edit, sync, or a finalizer call.

### 4. Let the outer runner finish

Only after child exit `0`, the runner:

1. records lifecycle proof;
2. runs one exact quiet `specstory sync claude -s UUID --silent`;
3. re-proves the exact session/path;
4. calls the finalizer with its parent-held token;
5. stages and sanitizes exact artifacts in a locked alternate index;
6. derives canonical trailers, writes private handoff drafts, and calls one
   ordinary `git commit -F` with normal hooks enabled; and
7. proves the resulting parent, tree, branch, and
   `Agent-History-Request` trailer.

Normal pre-commit execution is unsafe while a writer is active: when unstaged
changes exist, pre-commit can stash them, check out/modify staged content, then
restore the stash. That checkout/restore sequence can race a recorder and
clobber, conflict with, or reintroduce bytes. Therefore the pre-commit checker is
validation-only; the quiescent finalizer is the sole sanctioned mutator.

## Finalization outcomes

- **Success (`committed` / exit 0):** an ordinary hook-enabled commit is proven.
  Only now may rebase/update-base, integration, or retirement proceed.
- **Sanitation (`rotation_required` / exit 10):** exact index and live artifacts
  are sanitized, drafts are ready, no commit was attempted. Rotate first, then
  resume with fresh `--allow-commit --rotation-confirmed`; recovery does not
  restage.
- **Hook/commit failure (`commit_failed` / exit 11):** HEAD is unchanged and the
  exact prepared tree plus drafts remain. Fix the hook without changing that
  snapshot, then make one explicit recovery call with fresh `--allow-commit`.
  There is no automatic retry.
- **Uncertain outcome (exit 8):** reconcile only. Never issue another commit
  automatically; prove the exact HEAD or escalate for inspection.
- **Manual handoff:** LazyGit reads per-worktree
  `LAZYGIT_PENDING_COMMIT`; standard Git uses per-worktree `COMMIT_EDITMSG`.
  A draft makes recovery possible but is not proof that a commit happened.

An actual rebase is identified by Git's state directories (`rebase-merge` or
`rebase-apply`), not by a stale `REBASE_HEAD` file alone. Other active operation
markers and `index.lock` also block queue/finalization.

## Bootstrap a repository

Read
[`references/pre-commit-redaction-stack.md`](references/pre-commit-redaction-stack.md)
before bootstrap or migration.

> **Release blocker:** `ahh-v2.0.0` is an **UNPUBLISHED** future pin in the
> checked-in template. Downstream repos cannot fetch it yet. Publish the
> immutable tag before recommending fresh bootstrap, `--migrate`, or downstream
> use of `check-agent-artifact-secrets@ahh-v2.0.0`.

After that release exists:

```bash
bash skills/local/agent-history-hygiene/scripts/bootstrap-project.sh \
  --install-hook
pre-commit run --all-files
```

Bootstrap installs:

- a validation-only staged-index checker plus gitleaks;
- precise nested SpecStory state ignores, keeping `history/` visible;
- generic hygiene hooks whose mutators exclude every agent/archive/install root:
  `.agents`, `.claude`, `.codex`, `.cursor`, `.opencode`, `.specify`,
  `.specstory`; and
- optionally a validation-only `prepare-commit-msg` exact-selector gate.

Security checkers retain coverage of those roots. Excluding only `.specstory`
from whitespace/EOF/formatters is insufficient: `.agents/skills/` contains
installed vendored code, and `.claude/skills/` may symlink to it.

For old `ahh-v1.1.0` or exact local-redactor layouts, the post-release migration
is transactional and fail-closed:

```bash
bash skills/local/agent-history-hygiene/scripts/bootstrap-project.sh --migrate
```

It preserves compatible sibling hooks/options, validates a candidate before
publishing, and refuses ambiguous/customized legacy commands.

## Post-leak remediation

When a scan finds a real credential, or the user says it was committed/pushed:

1. stop any reflexive force-push;
2. read [`references/remediation.md`](references/remediation.md) end-to-end;
3. rotate at the provider regardless of blast radius; and
4. only then choose the least disruptive Git action from the runbook.

## Gotchas

- `.gitignore` does not untrack existing state. Use
  `bootstrap-project.sh --untrack-specstory-state`; never broaden the ignore to
  `.specstory/`.
- SpecStory >= 2.4.0 redacts on write but has context/rule gaps. Keep native
  redaction enabled and retain the finalizer check. Read
  [`references/specstory-native-redaction.md`](references/specstory-native-redaction.md)
  before changing placeholders or coverage.
- SpecStory 2.10 is checkout-path scoped, not branch scoped. Create the worktree
  first, then start one wrapper/session per change stream. `EnterWorktree` does
  not rebind an existing recorder.
- Exact discovery rejects incomplete JSONL, aliases, symlinks, unsafe bytes, and
  cross-worktree identity. Read
  [`references/transcript-session-discovery.md`](references/transcript-session-discovery.md)
  when resolution is empty or ambiguous.
- `plansDirectory` may be ignored at project scope in some Claude Code versions.
  Verify where the plan landed; user-level `"plansDirectory":
  "./.claude/plans"` is the recommended default.
- `pre-commit install` is per clone. CI is a second chance, not the last gate.
- `--install-hook` requires `core.hooksPath` genuinely unset. Empty, relative,
  global, or custom values are refused; integrate the validation-only gate in
  the configured hook directory yourself.
- `gitleaks protect` is deprecated. Use `gitleaks git --staged` or
  `gitleaks dir`.
- Rotate oversized sessions instead of raising the 2 MiB transcript allowance.

## Available scripts

- **`run-specstory-session.sh [--allow-commit] claude [-- OPTIONS...]`** — owns
  the foreground process group, preserves child/signal status, performs one
  post-exit exact sync, and optionally invokes one finalizer.
- **`queue-agent-commit.sh --commit --session-id UUID --specstory-path PATH
  (--plan PATH|--no-plan) --message-file PATH`** — writes one strict,
  metadata-only, per-worktree request; identical repeats are idempotent.
- **`finalize-agent-commit.sh --request ABSOLUTE_PATH
  (--allow-commit|--runner-token TOKEN) [--rotation-confirmed]`** — validates
  lifecycle/snapshot proof, prepares exact sanitized artifacts and drafts,
  executes one ordinary commit, and reconciles uncertain state without retry.
- **`find-session.sh (--session-id UUID|--specstory-path PATH|--newest)
  [--format specstory|claude|both] [--json]`** — exact checkout/session proof;
  `--newest` is heuristic compatibility only.
- **`stage-agent-artifacts.sh ...`** — exact or broad atomic staging.
  `--sanitize-index` sanitizes selected blobs in the locked alternate index;
  `--materialize-sanitized` safely writes those exact sanitized bytes back after
  generation checks; `--check-staged` never mutates.
- **`agent-commit-metadata.sh [--harness NAME --model NAME]
  [--format trailers|json]`** — derives canonical provenance from staged blobs.
- **`scan-staged.sh [--redact|--no-redact] [--config PATH] [--verbose]`** —
  validates the effective index; emits only bounded secret-free JSON findings
  and suppresses raw scanner output.
- **`probe-specstory-redaction.py [--json] [--keep] [--dry-run]`** — measures
  native coverage; exit 30 when SpecStory is absent.
- **`bootstrap-project.sh [--migrate] [--install-hook]
  [--untrack-specstory-state] [--force] [--dry-run]`** — installs/migrates the
  validation stack; remember the unpublished-v2.0.0 blocker above.

## Bundled assets

- `assets/artifact-dirs.txt` — canonical artifact directory set.
- `assets/pre-commit-config.yaml.template` — validation-only checker, gitleaks,
  and generic hygiene with full archive/install-root mutator exclusions.
- `assets/gitleaks.toml.template` — custom rules and scoped example allowlists.
- `assets/redact_secrets.py` — staged-index checker/sanitizer. `--check-index`
  accepts canonical or temporary commit indexes; `--fix-index` requires an
  explicit user-owned noncanonical `GIT_INDEX_FILE` and exact `--files`.
